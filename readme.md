# dist/images folder

The [project instructions](https://teamtreehouse.com/projects/using-gulp-to-build-a-front-end-website) say: 

`As a developer, I should be able to run the gulp images command at the command line to optimize the size of the projectâ€™s JPEG and PNG files, and then copy those optimized images to the dist/content folder.`

However, the index.html file looks for the images in `images/` folder so it is my understanding that `dist/images` needs to exist and contain the images, NOT `dist/content` as described in the instructions.
